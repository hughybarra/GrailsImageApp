#HyImageApp

Hello my name is Hugh Ybarra and your looking at the HyImageApp

Technology stack 

*Grails 
*Groovy 
*Javascript / Jquery 
*Css / Less 
*MongoDB

###What is it? 

The HyImageApp is a simple app where users can store images and share them with others.
The reason I chose to build this site was so that I could share images with a friend while working on projects together. 
Instead of using some of the free software available on the web I wanted to build something just for the two of us to collaborate with. This way we can share sensitive data between one another and not worry about others seeing our top secret images as we develop our project

I'm a huge Reddit and IMGUR fan so I based the style and design off of their website.

Originally I started building the site using AngularJS and the [firebase](https://www.firebase.com) back end. I wanted to get some practice using Angular and I always like working with firebase because it makes the front end development go a lot faster. 
My goal was to build the front end out and then later switch out the firebase with a more secure AJAX and web socket PHP back end. 

###What it does

Right now at this point in the project users are able to sign up and log in. They can add images to a global collection, view feature images and comment on them. More features are soon to come.
